Avoid hyphens and numbers, and ensure your name passes the radio test – can someone spell it after hearing it once?\n</p><p>Leverage familiar words or prefixes with clever twists (e.g., \"ZenPay\" for a payment service that conveys calm and ease). Consider the extension: while .com remains king, alternatives like .ai or .io can signal innovation in AI or tech.\n</p><p>Finally, validate your choice across social handles and trademarks, and secure the domain via trusted escrow services like Hoshi Vault’s partner network.</p>",

Valuation depends on several factors: length (shorter is better), extension (.com holds the highest value), keyword relevance to lucrative industries, and historical traffic or backlinks.\n</p><p>A memorable name with high exact-match search volume will attract more bidders, as will domains with strong commercial intent. Geographic domains tied to major cities or regions also fetch premiums.\n</p><p>Evaluate comparable sales and use appraisals cautiously – human context and negotiation dynamics often sway final pricing.

They also appeal to strategic buyers seeking immediate authority and search visibility in a region or sector.\n</p><p>When assessing geo/category domains, look for cities with high economic growth and verticals with long-term demand. At Hoshi Vault, we curate clusters designed for compounding value and synergy across assets.</p>",
